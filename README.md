<h1>Arduino Robotic Arm</h1>

This project includes a robotic arm controller based on the Arduino platform. The arm servomotors are programmed in C++, which is the main tool for writing program code for Arduino microcontrollers. The robotic arm is controlled through a special interface developed in the Python programming language.
